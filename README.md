A PWA made with Vue + Bun + Supabase that I've been building for things to make my life easier. It started as just a way to get more comfortable with Vue and try out Bun and Supabase, but now I use it every day. Simple apps built just for me :)

So far I've got;
- Weather
- An agenda
- An expense tracker
- A fitness tracker
