# stan

A Bun backend to that connects to Supabase and exposes a REST API on top, has some cron jobs, and some pretty scuffed auth. I could've just went straight from FE to Supabase but eventually I'd like to build this out more for some Notion integration & other ways to CRUD my data

Don't ask me why it's called stan
